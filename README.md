#Standing Wave Script

This script takes input for different variables involved
with creating the standing wave position equation
and can find the equation for wave transverse position at 
position x and time t, and the wave transverse velocity
at position x and time t. This script is still a work in
progress as there are still issues with the wave transverse 
velocity and the possibility of finding wave horizontal velocity
with the tension and linear mass density in the string has not
yet been included, along with some issues with transverse velocity.
